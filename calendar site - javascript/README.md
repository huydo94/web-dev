#Creative portion:

For the creative portion, we implemented a functionality where users can categorize their events according to some tags and filter the event list of each day based on that tag.

We also implemented a sharing feature where an user can create a group event with another user. Both users will be able to view, edit and delete that event. The calendar also shows the username of the original event creator. 

The tagging functionality also works along well with the sharing feature.
